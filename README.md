# PLayingWithTCP

PlayingWithTcp is a simple app that implements a simple tcp connection with a simple JAVA server using Sockets. 
The app can send and receive message from and to a JAVA server.

In this simple experiment were used: 

1. Java Sockets. 
2. RxJava was used for handling the events in different threads, taking into account that AsyncTask was deprecated. 
3. MVP. 

The app represents the client and the files in the TcpServerImplement represent the server. The server was built in Eclipse.
